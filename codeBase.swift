let codeBase = ["Leo" : ["Your self-esteem seems dependent on what others think of you, but the real problem is you could be reading people incorrectly today.

You might be at a loss, not knowing where to start or how you will make your point once you begin talking. Thankfully, you are not making a formal presentation like you would at school or at work. There’s no need to have everything all mapped out. Start slowly and see where the conversation goes without harboring any expectations. Seth Godin wrote, “The easiest thing is to react.

In fact, it’s challenging to stick to the facts now, especially when you are conjuring up vivid fantasies. Ironically, you might be convinced that your communication skills are impeccable, but you’re not likely doing as well as you think. You see no reason to acknowledge a dark cloud when the silver lining is such a wonderful conversational topic. Nevertheless, J.K.

But you can find pleasure in every experience if you readjust your thinking and embrace the notion that the journey is more important than the destination.

                "Pisces" : ["It doesn’t seem to matter how carefully you explain yourself today because people tend to misunderstand you anyway, but communication is a two-way street and it’s wise to check how well you’re listening, too. Although change is in the air, it’s too soon to tell where your current relationships might lead. In the meantime, try not to assume anything now.

                "Aquarius" : ["Personal relationships continue to be the primary playing field upon which you’re unfolding your life. But the straightforward communication that’s associated with one-to-one interactions isn’t as useful when emotions are entangled in ways that aren’t apparent. Unfortunately, logic won’t help you separate all the threads of interrelated feelings now. You might need to leave your analytical tools in the toolbox and trust your instincts today.
